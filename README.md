# hello-world
Beginner repository... I'll throw anything and everything in here I suppose.
My name is Pierce, and I'm new to programming. I'm about to take on a codecademy intensive course, starting tomorrow.
I will have to see if it's the right option for me, as I've already got a busy schedule and I'm working full time. So maybe now's not the best time to get into all this!

Excited to learn a new skill though.
